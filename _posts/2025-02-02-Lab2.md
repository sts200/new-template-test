## Setup the IMU

I connected the IMU to the Artemis Nano using the braided QWIC connector, as show below.

Then, I installed the SparkFun ICM-20948 library in the Arduino IDE and ran the example code.

AD0_VAL defines the last bit of the IMU's I2C address. Since we are only using one IMU in this lab, AD0_VAL should be set to the default of 1. Being able to change the I2C address on the IMU allows for the daisy-chaining of multiple IMUs steming from the same I2C connection.

When the board is placed flat on the table, it experiences no acceleration in the x and y directions, but it is pulled downwards in the z-direction by gravity. In the serial plot above, we can see that the acceleration value in the z-direction is around 980, (representing $9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$). The x, y, and z values on the serial plotter increase when the device is rotated along the respective positive axis. While the accelerometer measures linear acceleration, a gyroscope measures angular velocity. This means that the gyroscope produces all zero outputs if the board is perfectly still, but will produce an output at the approporate axis if moved.

I added a visual indication that the board is running by blinking the LED three times on startup. I did this using the same BlinkWithoutDelay example code as lab 1.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='Fg_Rk-NJHLw' %}

```cpp
if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval && blinks < BLINKS_ON_STARTUP) {
    // save the last time you blinked the LED
    previousMillis = currentMillis;

    // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
    if (ledState == LOW) {
        ledState = HIGH;
    } else {
        ledState = LOW;
        blinks = blinks + 1;
    }
    // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
}
```
