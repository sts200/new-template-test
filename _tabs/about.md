# Steven Sun

Hello, I'm Steven Sun, a senior at Cornell University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My interests include embedded systems, digital ASIC design, and home automation. On my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, rock climbing, and playing Souls-like games. I hope you enjoy keeping up with my work in Fast Robots!
